Simple RPG is a small game where you can pick your actions toward an end goal (killing the dragon!). Looking forward on adding some small tweaks and upgrades to the current version of the game.

**Upcoming**
* Enemy scaling with your current XP
* Health and damage randomizer RNG
* More weapons
* More paths
* Proper Styling
